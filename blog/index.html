        <a href="http://www.sonarqube.org/">SonarQube</a> (formerly Sonar) has become a standard code quality tool for Java applications.
        With recent releases, it has become easier to analyse code other than Java, even all within
        the same project. This means that you can now bring code quality analysis to your JavaScript
        code, too. In this blog post, we show you how.

          Web Applications with Play! – An introduction</a>

      <p>
        Play! is an open-source framework for building web applications in Java or Scala.
        It is stateless and promotes RESTfulness: it embraces web-oriented architecture.
        But best of all, Play is simple, fast and ultimately fun. It is also pretty powerful
        and allows the development of sophisticated web applications in an efficient way.
        akquinet is now using Play as the basis for different applications.
      </p>
      <p>
        To illustrate how easy and powerful Play is, this blog post presents a miniature web application.

      <p>
        Back in 2008, I shifted my working days to Tuesday to Friday in the office, then
        from home on Saturdays. Overall it worked well, but some Saturdays were harder
        than others. I wasn’t sure why, but on those days I found it particularly hard to
        concentrate, and ended up having to work on and off…
