    Hi, this is Alice Rose. I am a full-stack developer specialising in web frontends.
    I get excited about technologies and tools, especially if they enable me to create new,
    unique and lean web experiences. I am continually learning from books, blogs and
    podcasts.
  </p>

    Some things I have been enjoying recently are, in no particular order,
    <a href="http://pathtoperf.com/">The Path to Performance</a> (a podcast
    about web performance by Tim Kadlec and Katie Kovalcin),
    <a href="http://abookapart.com/products/responsible-responsive-design">Responsible
    Responsive Design</a> (a book about current best practices in responsive web
    design by Scott Jehl), and <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a>,
    Facebook's stateful JavaScript UI library.
  </p>

  <p>
    I am a linguistics geek and speak English and German fluently.
    I like travelling around the world, playing guitar and watching films in my spare time.
